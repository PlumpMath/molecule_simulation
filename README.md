# Molecule Simulation #

This is a molecular simulation I created using Blender Game Engine around 2014. All the gaming logic uses Python.

### Features ###
* Molecules are built by placing atoms close to eachother. 
* Atoms in molecules interact according to VSEPR theory and the ball and spring model. 
* Small organic molecules have shapes similar to those observed in real life. 
* Automatic naming of simple molecules based on their component elements.
* Supports double and triple bonds.
* Building blocks include Hydrogen, Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Bromine, Hydroxide and Hydron. 
* Visual indicators for lone pair valence electrons. 
* FPS style camera movement and control scheme.

Note: This is a 3D simulation, even though the models appear 2D in these screenshots.

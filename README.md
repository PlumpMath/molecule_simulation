This is a molecular simulation I created using Blender Game Engine around 2014. 

The gaming logic uses Python.

If atoms are next to eachother, they automatically form molecules. Their shape is determined using
VSEPR theory and the ball and spring model. 

The shapes are fairly accurate for small molecules, but larger molecules have different shapes than 
those observed in reality. 

Another feature of this simulation is automatic naming of simple molecules based on their component elements.   

If you would like to run it, first install blender. 

Then open molecules.blend.

Then press P. 

Here is the control scheme for the simulation/game:
	
Esc: Exit
W,A,S,D: Movement
R: reset
1,2,3,4,5,6: Switch between elements
Left click: Fire element
Right click: Fire carbon element

Other:
    
Space: fire antimatter (destroys elements)
T: fire laser
